# LLM-PROMPT-RECOVERY
In this project, the goal is to find the prompt used to transform a given text. Specifically, we're seeking the prompt or instruction used in the Gemma 7B-it model to convert one text to another.I have used Gemma 2b-it model with LoRA for this prompt recovery task using KerasNLP. We were not provided the training dataset for building the model, so external datasets that utilize the Gemma 7B model to transform texts using prompts are used to train the model.

Ultimately these steps got me great accuracy on the test dataset.
